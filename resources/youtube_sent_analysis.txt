opinion extraction
opinion mining
sentiment mining
subjectivity analysis

Negation_ add NOT_ to every token between the negation and the next punctuation.
Boolean Multinomial Naive Bayes: record each word once for every document. Works better
MaxEnt and SVM might be better than Naive Bayes

sentiment lexicons - e.g.
  the general inquirer,
  LLIWC (lots of classes) - not free!
  MPQA - annotates strength
  Bing Liu opinion lexicon, pos/neg
  SentiWordNet

Identifying word polarity :
  (McKeown):
    and - same polarity
    but - opposite polarity

  Turney Algorithm - better performance for +/- detection:
    extract 2wrd phrases with adjectives
    define their polarity: co-occurrence (Pointwise Mutual Information - estimated by Altavista)
    find average

  WordNet - online thesaurus:
    start from initial seed sets for + and -
    follow chains of synonyms/antonyms to get to a word

Finding attribute/aspect/target:
  - e.g., when talking about a hotel, can train a classifier to assign an aspect to a sentence:
   given the sentence, is the aspect food, decor, service, value or NONE

NOTE: classes are not equally balanced. Severe imbalance can degrade classifier performance
