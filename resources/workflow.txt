1. Try polarity on St Andrews data:
	use twitter API to get tweets about St Andrews - [DONE]. No way to use coordinates because most of people of not use them. Maybe use user.location ? 
	use existing polarity tools to make analysis.
		- knowledge-based: 
			- TextBlob - around 60%
		- statistical:
			- my own very simple classifier: 62%
		- hybrid: 
	come to a conclusion - do I need to create something of my own or are the existing tools good enough?
